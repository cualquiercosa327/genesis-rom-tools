***Release .50B***

**BugFix
-The double buffer was reallocated to the wrong size after dumping an image map,
 causing possible crashes
-PCX output files calculated the size incorrectly, which led to a junk border in
 some viewers and a corrupt image in others
-Object Def RAM was mismanaged, causing problems with loading one after another
-Default object def images were 320x224, the required size is 320x200. Larger
 images caused crashes when trying to write beyond the input buffer boundary
-Selectionbox position for selecting and drawing to tiles, blocks, and chunks
 was miscalculated, leading to writes outside of any one data's boundary and
 sometimes causing crashes
-There were mistakes in the de/reallocation of level data storage RAM that could
 lead to crashes
-Originally when a new file was loaded after another in the same session, the first
 file wasn't freed from RAM, causing slow loss of free memory
-Filesize was miscalculated during reads, which lead to a file growing by one byte
 during a save once for each time it was loaded
-The ROM was clipped at the end of the level data, leading to the loss of data
 created by other programs
-Misc art storage wasn't properly initialized, leading to memory and crash problems
-Crashes would occur between loading certain files because the editor was allowed
 to draw an update before all relevant data was loaded
-Data for Casino Night bumpers in Sonic 2 was being read in the wrong order
-The editor keys to change the CNZ bumper types weren't enabled
-The wrong 256x256 chunk would be affected when attempting to change the propertiles
 of it's inner 16x16 blocks in Sonic 1 and Sonic CD
-compress.exe and expand.exe were mistakenly left out of the distribution, disallowing
 the use of Sonic CD PC support

**Other
-The old method for calculating filesize traveled through the file byte-by-byte to
 obtain a pre-calculated number for allocating RAM at once, effectively reading the
 whole file twice. A better method eliminates that process.
-The old method for calling the external "compress" and "expand" programs relied on
 a fixed-value timer to wait until either program was finished, because Windows'
 "CreateProcess" function for calling external programs will not suspend the parent
 program (SonED) while a DOS program runs. SonED cannot read from the decompressed
 files until the external programs are finished without failing, so if the timer was
 ever insufficient, the program would crash. The new method utilizes a third DOS
 program, which mediates between SonED and the compress/expand programs. It will
 suspend while they run, and when they are finished, a flag file is created, which
 SonED is constantly checking for in the background. When the file is found, the
 process is complete. It is deleted, and SonED continues to load
-Convinient access to the ReadMe is now allowed through the "Help" menu
-StealthPatch is now part of the SonED distribution package for easier access
-Small updates to S2 object def, now includes graphical representation and description
 for EHZ bridge objects, all spike sets, and all path swapper objects
-Slight improvements were made in level drawing speed
-An object type selector has been implemented to quickly change the type of an object
 to any type that is described in the currently-loaded object def file
-Quick-save to ROM. F3 performs a "Write->ROM->All" (ignoring items that can't be
 written to the ROM) to the last level that was loaded by either "Read->ROM->All"
 or by a save-state, and automatically saves the ROM to the same file it was loaded from
-A data-dump system has been added for Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 for managing the placement
 of individual parts manually. The files generated contain data as it would appear in-ROM


***Release .30B***

- This "What's New" list
- Fixed bug that caused Sonic 2 level and tile data not to be saved
- Level/Tile/Palette/Object Support for editing Sonic CD for PC (both versions)
- Optimized map drawing for faster performance
- Implemented Full Screen Mode (F4 to toggle)
- Tile cursor translucency is disabled by default (faster drawing)
- Translucency off allows 8-bit color in full-screen mode (faster)
- Set default scroll speed higher
- Dragging objects to the edge of the window scrolls the level
- Holding CTRL key while setting object properties will add 16 for quicker type switching
- Games that can load all data from ROM don't require a save-state at startup (currently only Sonic 2 and Sonic CD)
