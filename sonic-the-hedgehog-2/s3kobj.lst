;Object Listing gives identity to each of the objects listed
;- Main ID is the high byte of the object value (hex value)
;- Secondary ID is the low byte of the object's value (hex value)
;- # of Zones is the number of zones that contain a different definition
;  for this object. If the object remains constant, it must be set to 1.
;  Values after this repeat for as many times as the value of this entry
;- Zone Entry is the zone that this object entry is valid in. All entries
;  must at least have a default entry (the data used on all levels that
;  do not have any extra data specifically listed for them). If the entry
;  is the default entry, this value must be 0x18 (hex value)
;- XMin the leftmost offset (in pixels) from the object position that the
;  mouse pointer can touch
;- XMax the rightmost offset (in pixels) from the object position that the
;  mouse pointer can touch
;- YMin the topmost offset (in pixels) from the object position that the
;  mouse pointer can touch
;- YMax the bottommost offset (in pixels) from the object position that the
;  mouse pointer can touch
;- Description contains a (40 char max) textual description of the object
;- Property ? indicates that the following information is for any of the
;  special properties (the third number listed inside SonED). There are
;  0x0F (16) of these, and not all of them represent something unique.
;  If the value here is set to the value of the current entry or above,
;  then you will need to enter the following types of data for this entry.
;  If the value is set to the value of a previous entry, then the data
;  will be taken from that entry instead, and you need-not list anything.
;  All data prompts for this entry are preceded by a -.
;- # of Sprites is how many individual sprites to combine to make a visual
;  representation of this object (all qualities of individual sprites are
;  listed after this item with a - at the beginning)
;- Sprite ? ID is the ID number of the sprite (in it's respective set) that
;  you wish to be drawn
;- Set is the sprite set in which the sprite you want is located
;- Direction is the direction you would like the sprite to be drawn-
;  * 0- Normal
;  * 1- Backwards
;  * 2- Upside-down
;  * 3- Backwards and Upside-down
;- xoff is the offset on the x axis from the objects position where you want
;  the sprite to be drawn
;- yoff is the offset on the y axis from the objects position where you want
;  the sprite to be drawn
